  // Parameters that affect performance

  // Amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log
  // on disk) before converting to a sorted on-disk file.
  //
  // Larger values increase performance, especially during bulk loads.
  // Up to two write buffers may be held in memory at the same time,
  // so you may wish to adjust this parameter to control memory usage.
  // Also, a larger write buffer will result in a longer recovery time
  // the next time the database is opened.
  //
  // Default: 4MB

  // one open file per 2MB of working set).
